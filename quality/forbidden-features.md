# Forbidden Features
{: .no_toc }

Java has grown to be a complex language with many features. We don't have time to teach all of these features in CSE 143, so we have a general rule that submitted work should only use language features and programming concepts taught in the course.

The following features should not be used in assessments.

- `break`, `continue`, `return` from a `void` method.
- `try`, `catch`, and annotations.
- Java 8 features, such as lambdas, streams, and method references.
- Java 11 features, such as local variable type inference.
- `toArray` and `clone`.
- `StringBuilder`, `StringBuffer`, `StringJoiner`, `StringTokenizer`, and the `String` methods `toCharArray`, `join`, and `matches`.
- `Arrays.asList`, `Arrays.copyOf`, `Arrays.copyOfRange`, and `Arrays.sort`.
- `Collections.copy`, `Collections.sort`.
- `LinkedHashMap`.
