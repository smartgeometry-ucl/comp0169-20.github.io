The final project is your opportunity to create something new that you want to share with the rest of the world. So long as your project draws upon the course's lessons, the nature of your project is entirely up to you, though subject to final staff approval. Your project should be primarily implemented in Java (recommended), [Processing](https://www.processing.org/), [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/), [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/), [Python](https://www.python.org/), [Go](https://golang.org/), or any flavor of [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/). You are welcome to utilize any infrastructure, provided the staff can access any required software and hardware.

All that we ask is that you build something of interest to you, that you solve an actual problem, that you impact campus, or that you change the world. Strive to create something that outlives this course.

The final project is a collaborative activity: everyone is required to work in groups of either 2 or 3 students. You may not work alone. It is expected that every student contributes equally to the design and implementation of that group's project. We expect each student in a group to contribute between 16--20 hours of labor towards the project since it represents 3 weeks of work in the course. Although no more than three students may design and implement a given project, you are welcome to solicit advice from others so long as the final implementation represents your own work. If you incorporate a few lines of code found online, cite the source with inline comments. [Be reasonable.](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/WAC/default.aspx?cite=478-121-107)

Here are just some of the possibilities. Discuss ideas with the staff and search for collaborators on the Ed discussion board.

- A web app, based in part on the assessment examples.
- An Android or iOS app.
- A Chrome extension.
- A hardware app for tangible or wearable technology.
- A conversational agent or digital assistant.
- A significant extension to one of our guided projects.

Extensions on the final project are not ordinarily granted, except in cases of emergency.

## Preproposal

Intended to promote early thought, the preproposal is your opportunity to bounce one or more ideas off of the staff.

- What idea(s) do you have for your project?
- If you plan to collaborate with one or two other students, what are their names, and who are their TAs?
- Do you have any questions of your own?

## Proposal

The proposal is your opportunity to receive approval and counsel from the staff before you proceed to design. The staff will either approve your proposal or require modifications on your part for subsequent approval. Your proposal, even if approved, is not binding; you may alter your plan at any point, provided you obtain the staff's approval for any modifications. Projects submitted without approval may not receive credit.

- What will (likely) be the title of your project?
- Pitch your project in one or two sentences.
- Describe your project in one or more paragraphs. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. It's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than initially hoped.

- Define a **good** outcome for your project. What functionality will you definitely accomplish?
- Define a **better** outcome for your project. What do you think you can accomplish by the deadline?
- Define a **best** outcome for your project. What do you hope to accomplish by the deadline?

Finally, outline your next steps in one or more paragraphs.

- What new skills will you need to acquire?
- What topics will you need to research?
- If working with one or two other students, who will do what?

## Status report

Not only is the status report intended to keep the staff apprised of your progress, it is an opportunity to keep yourself on track. Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your TA directly!

- What have you done for your project so far?
- What have you not done for your project yet?
- What problems, if any, have you encountered?

## Implementation

Ultimately due are implementation and documentation of your project. Include the following in an Ed workspace:

- Documentation for your project in the form of a file called `README.txt` or `README.md` (if you prefer Markdown). This documentation is to be a user's manual for your project. Though the structure of your documentation is entirely up to you, it should be incredibly clear to the staff how and where, if applicable, to compile, configure, and use your project. Your documentation should be at least several paragraphs in length. It should not be necessary for us to contact you with questions regarding your project after its submission. Hold our hand with this documentation; be sure to answer in your documentation any questions that you think we might have while testing your work.
- A **design document** for your project in the form of a file called `DESIGN.txt` or `DESIGN.md` that discusses, technically, how you implemented your project and why you made each design decision. Your design document should be at least several paragraphs in length. Whereas your documentation is meant to be a user's manual, consider your design document your opportunity to give the staff a technical tour of your project's implementation details.
- Any and all files required to run your software (even if intended for infrastructure other than Ed), including source code as well as, if applicable, configuration files, sample inputs, databases, and so forth. All source code should be thoroughly commented.
- A short video that's no more than 5 minutes in length in which you present your project to the world with slides, screenshots, voiceover, and/or live action. Your video should somehow include your project's title, your name and year, and any other details that you'd like to convey to viewers. Host the video on either Loom, Canvas, Google Drive, OneDrive, or YouTube with a publicly-accessible link.

## Reflection

In a file named `reflection.txt`, write a paragraph-long reflection answering the following questions (along with anything else you find appropriate):

- What did you learn during this project?
- What did you enjoy during this project?
- What did you find challenging or frustrating during this project?
- What did you find particularly helpful for your learning during this project?
